      <!-- Why we make guitars -->

        <div class="content">
          <h2>Why we make guitars</h2>
          <p>
            In mid-2007, Austin started with a twelve-string acoustic guitar,
            which was what he learned on and always had. His friend Terry
            advised him to get a six-string for playing lead, as the
            twelve-string was more suited for chords. Unable to afford the
            guitar he wanted, Austin decided to build one. While searching for
            guitar-building tips, he found a lack of information on what NOT to
            do. This led him to create a blog to document his mistakes and help
            others avoid them.
            <br /><br />After Terry introduced Austin to his Fender Telecaster,
            Austin fell in love with its sleek design and vintage twang. He
            decided to focus on custom Telecasters, combining knowledge from top
            players and critics. If you can dream it, we can likely build it for
            you. Today, we make nearly any guitar you can think of and we love a
            challenge to the end. We hope you'll enjoy one someday.
